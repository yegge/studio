# **App Name**: Album Explorer

## Core Features:

- Fetch Albums: Fetches a list of albums from the user provided supabase URL. Does not use the relational aspects.
- Display Albums: Displays a list of album names using an appropriate component (probably a `<ul>` list) based on the list generated from the user supplied Supabase URL.
- Album Details: Show details (tracks) of each album when it is selected from the main page.
- Filter Albums: The app should be able to allow the user to supply the database location.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7), evoking a sense of creativity and artistry.
- Background color: Very light purple (#F3E5F5), providing a subtle contrast to the primary color.
- Accent color: Cyan (#00BCD4) is used sparingly to draw attention to key interactive elements and links.
- Headline font: 'Belleza', sans-serif font for headlines and titles to give an artistic feel.
- Body font: 'Alegreya', a serif font used to support readability where necessary.
- Use minimalist icons to represent various options and actions. Icons should complement the modern design.
- Employ a clean, grid-based layout with ample white space to ensure a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate interface. Make sure content is easily legible and user experience is streamlined.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience. For example, album covers might have a soft fade-in effect.
